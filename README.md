# Zen Editor (for ADHD Sufferers :wink:)

_Reach true ZEN in your editor_

Quite a simple solution that increases productivity, now you can keep
visual context while the tab bar is hidden.

Features:

- Every editor is decorated with a header, which includes the title and file path
- More to come in the future...
